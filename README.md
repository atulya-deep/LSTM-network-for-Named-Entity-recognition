# LSTM-network-for-Named-Entity-recognition
Named Entity Recognition (NER) models can be used to identify the mentions of people, location, organization, times, company names, and so on. So the Named Entity Recognition model not only acts as a standard tool for information extraction but it also serves as a foundational and important preprocessing toll for many downstream applications like Machine Translation, Question-Answering, Customer Feedback Handling, and even Text Summarization.
